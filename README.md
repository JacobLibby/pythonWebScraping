# pythonWebScraping
repo containing code for web scraping using Python

# Getting Started
You will need to install Google Chrome and the Google Chrome driver in order for this project to work, as selenium will use Chrome to load webpages. This is so that we can scrape websites that use Javascript to load elements.


# Plans to Complete Repo
* Continue commenting code
* Create optional CLI to return full html or specific sections of the scraped webpage
* Test code on a series of websites to see how it scrapes different sites and their elements
* Include test cases in repo to show functionality
* Complete README with thorough download and run instructions
